# Lyme-Disease-Analysis
This project involved construction of a data warehouse to aid in analysis of the geographical and environmental factors involved in the spread of Lyme disease. Star schemas were designed based on the predefined key questions, ETL was applied to extract and combine data from multiple data sources and to transform this data into a structured and consistent datastore, and data was then loaded into the data warehouse. This approach allowed for Microsoft Power BI utilization so that visualizations can be created to present research results. The result is a database that allows researchers and the public to dynamically analyze trends in the spread of Lyme disease, an important and dangerous public health threat.
